# ArcGIS Visualization
This tutorial will look at the steps necessary for ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online as a geospatial data visualization tool.

----

## Setup Instructions
In preparation for this tutorial, you will need an organizational account with Esri. If you are a Brock user, you will sign into the software using your Brock credentials and the organization's URL brock.maps.arcgis.com.

**The Scenario**

We will be mapping tree sample data for the neighbourhood of Bridgewater near Niagara Falls and Chippewa. Tabular data was joined with the geospatial data creating a powerful connection that will allow us to visualize attributes such as diameter at breast height and tree species. Although this example uses point data, the same general steps could apply to boundary files such as census tracts or municipal boundaries and associated tabular data.

----

## Visualization in ArcGIS Pro
Although there are many ways of creating visualizations using GIS technologies, we will explore some simple options for unique colours and proportional symbols. 

1. Run ArcGIS Pro and sign in using the organization's sign in workflow


Add joined data from previous activity
map properties > coordinate system > UTM > projected > NAD 1983

with the layer selected > Feature Layer > Symbology
display tree species by colour
group items
add attribute > size > DBH
adjust settings

save

## Next Steps (Optional)
This is where you can add any additional resources, follow up tutorial, or workshop reccomendations that users might use to continue learning about the tool described in the tutorial.  The more the better!
